This is a Exploratory Data Analysis project which I conducted over Lego.  
<br>
<br>
This is a data science project that is done on a LEGO data set to answer the following questions and visualise the data.
1.	The number of LEGO sets released year-on-year. How do the number of sets released in 1955 compare to the number of sets released in 2019?

2.	The number of different themes shipped by year.

3.	The number of themes released by year. Only include the full calendar years (i.e., exclude 2020 and 2021)

4.	Has the size and complexity of LEGO sets increased over time based on the number of parts? Plot the average number of parts over time.

5.	Number of Sets per LEGO Theme

**Expected Outcomes**:

1. What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created, and how many parts did it have?
2. In which year were the first LEGO sets released, and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?
3. Which LEGO theme has the most sets?
4. When did the LEGO company really take off based on its product offerings? How many themes and sets did it release every year?
5. Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?


**Languages and Tools: Python: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib**
**The data was visualised using multiple plots, like scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts with multiple axes.**
